Strings in java script are a fundamental data type thet represents a sequence of charachter

Strings created with single or double quotes works the same.

Search() Method: The Searc() method searches a stirng for a string(or a regular expression) and returns the position of the match.

//Returns the index number where the first match is found. Returns -1 if no match is found.

//mathc(): Returns an array of the matched values or null if no match is found.


Strings are Immutable

You cannot change a character directly.

let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "Y";  
console.log(str); // Hello (no change)


Is JavaScript String Primitive or Object?

By default, a string is a primitive data type

JavaScript automatically converts it into a String object when methods are applied

👉 This is called auto-boxing

Difference Between == and === for Strings

== → compares values only

=== → compares value + data type

Using === is always recommended.

What is Template Literal?

Template literals use backticks (`) and allow:

Variable interpolation

Multi-line strings

They make string handling easier and more readable.

How are Strings Stored in Memory?

Strings are stored as sequences of characters

Each character has an index, starting from 0

Memory is allocated as read-only because strings are immutable

7️⃣ What is String Length?

length returns the total number of characters

Includes spaces and special characters

8️⃣ Difference Between slice(), substring(), and substr()

slice() → supports negative index

substring() → does not support negative index

substr() → uses start index + length (deprecated)


What is Unicode in JavaScript Strings?

JavaScript strings are based on Unicode, allowing support for:

Multiple languages

Emojis

Special symbols

Why are Strings Important in Frontend Development?

Used for UI text

Form validation

API responses

DOM manipulation

User input handling

// includes(): Returns true if the string contains the specified value, and false otherwise.
note: includes() is case sensitive. includes() is an ES6 feature.

// startsWith(): The startsWith() method returns true if a string begins with a specified value. Otherwise it retun false.
//
java script counts positions from zero
Slice() extracts up to but not including indexEnd

Substring: Extracts a portion of the string based on starting and ending indices
//syntax
substring(indexStart) // index start with Zero.
substring(index)
substring() extracts up to but not including indexEnd.
//new
//API (Application Programming Interface)
//HTTP Method

substring: Extracts a portion of the string based on starting and ending of indices
//camelCase is used to seperate words, substring is not to be intended as substring but as substring

charCodeAt(): The charCodeAt method returns the code of the character at a specified index in a string. The method returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535)

Case-Insensitive : To perform a case-sensitive replacement, you can use the i flag in the regular expression.
