Java script array is an object that represents a similar types of elements.

Each value (name) will be called as an element 
In an array, the first index is called the lower index or lower boundary, and the last index is called the upper index or upper boundary.

eg - let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
eg - let students = ["sam","Rushi","Vik"];  
Arrays in java script can be created using the array constructor or with the array literals (square brackets[]).
1: using Array constructor 
let fruits = new Array("Apple","Orange","Mango");
console.log(fruits);

// Return Value:
//? forEach: It dosen't return a value. The forEach method is used for iterating over the elements of an aaray and performing a side effect, such as modifying the array or performing a task for each element.

// forEach: It dosent retun a value, so it cannot be directly chaineed with arry methods.

//map : Since it retun a new array you can chain other array method 

//How to Insert, Add, Replace and Delete Elements in Array(CRUD)

1: push(): Method that adds one or more elements to the end of array
2: pop(): Method that removes the last element from array.
3: Unshift(): Method that add one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
4: shift(): Method that removes the first element from an array

Filters in array
indexOf(): The indexOf method returns index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

Syntax: indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)

lastIndexOf() method : The lastIndexOf() method of array instance returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array or -1 if it is not present.  The array is searched backwards, stating at fromIndex

//Filter in an array
1: find Method: THe find method is used to find first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function. It returns matching element or undefine if no element is found.

2. Is JavaScript array fixed size?

Answer:
No. JavaScript arrays are dynamic. Their size can grow or shrink at runtime.

🔹 3. How is a JavaScript array different from an object?

Answer:

Arrays store data using numeric indexes

Objects store data using key–value pairs

Arrays maintain order, objects do not guarantee order

7. What are sparse arrays?

Answer:
Arrays with missing indexes are called sparse arrays.

Example:

let arr = [];
arr[3] = 10;


Difference between splice() and slice()?
//
//
Answer:

splice() modifies original array

slice() returns new array without modifying original
JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types

//javascript object

An Object is a variable that can hold many variables.
Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key (known as property names) has a value.

Objects can describe anything like houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.

// Create an Object
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Create an Object
const person = {};

// Add Properties
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";


JavaScript variables are containers for data.

JavaScript variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Modern JavaScript
Using let
Using const
Older JavaScript
Using var (Not Recommended)
Automatically (Not Recommended)

An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.

Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:

Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.

Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.

Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
//
Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).

Typed Array Benefits
Typed Arrays were designed to provide an efficient way to handle binary data, unlike traditional JavaScript arrays which can hold elements of mixed data types.

Typed arrays are raw memory, so JavaScript can pass them directly to any function without converting the data to another representation.

Typed arrays are seriously faster than normal arrays for passing data to functions that can use raw binary data. Typed Arrays are highly suitable for:

WebGL and Canvas:
Fast graphics rendering and image processing.
File APIs:
Fast reading and writing of local files
