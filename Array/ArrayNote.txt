Java script array is an object that represents a similar types of elements.

Each value (name) will be called as an element 
In an array, the first index is called the lower index or lower boundary, and the last index is called the upper index or upper boundary.

eg - let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
eg - let students = ["sam","Rushi","Vik"];  
Arrays in java script can be created using the array constructor or with the array literals (square brackets[]).
1: using Array constructor 
let fruits = new Array("Apple","Orange","Mango");
console.log(fruits);

// Return Value:
//? forEach: It dosen't return a value. The forEach method is used for iterating over the elements of an aaray and performing a side effect, such as modifying the array or performing a task for each element.

// forEach: It dosent retun a value, so it cannot be directly chaineed with arry methods.

//map : Since it retun a new array you can chain other array method
