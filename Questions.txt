JavaScript Interview Notes (Quick Revision)
What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, high-level scripting language

Used to create dynamic and interactive web applications

Runs on browser and server (Node.js)

JavaScript Data Types
Primitive

String

Number

Boolean

Undefined

Null

BigInt

Symbol

Non-Primitive

Object

Array

Function

👉 Primitive types are immutable.

var vs let vs const
Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function	Block	Block
Re-declare	Yes	No	No
Re-assign	Yes	Yes	No
Hoisted	Yes (undefined)	Yes (TDZ)	Yes (TDZ)

Hoisting

JavaScript moves declarations to the top

var is initialized as undefined

let and const are in Temporal Dead Zone

== vs ===

== → compares value only

=== → compares value + type ✅ (preferred)

What is Closure?

A function that remembers variables from its outer scope

Even after outer function execution is finished

👉 Used in data hiding, callbacks, event handlers

What is Scope?

Global scope

Function scope

Block scope (let, const)

What is Callback Function?

A function passed as an argument to another function

Executed after some operation completes

Used in:

Event handling

API calls

Async operations


What is Promise?

Represents eventual completion or failure of async operation

States:

Pending

Fulfilled

Rejected

Used to avoid callback hell

async / await

Cleaner way to write async code

Makes async code look synchronous

Built on top of Promises


What is Event Loop?

JavaScript is single-threaded

Event loop handles async tasks

Moves tasks from callback queue to call stack

this Keyword

Depends on how a function is called

Global → window

Object method → object itself

Arrow function → lexical scope

Arrow Functions

Shorter syntax

Does NOT have:

this

arguments

super

Used in callbacks and functional programming


Array vs Object
Array	Object
Indexed	Key-value
Ordered	Unordered
Stores list	Stores entity

What is DOM?

Document Object Model

Represents HTML as a tree structure

JS uses DOM to manipulate UI
